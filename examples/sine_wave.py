Kalman Filter tracking a sine wave
==================================

This example shows how to use the Kalman Filter for state estimation.

In this example, we generate a fake target trajectory using a sine wave.
Instead of observing those positions exactly, we observe the position plus some
random noise.  We then use a Kalman Filter to estimate the velocity of the
system as well.

The figure drawn illustrates the observations, and the position and velocity
estimates predicted by the Kalman Smoother.

rnd = np.random.RandomState(0)

# generate a noisy sine wave to act as our fake observations
n_timesteps = 100
x = np.linspace(0, 3 * np.pi, n_timesteps)
observations = 20 * (np.sin(x) + 0.5 * rnd.randn(n_timesteps))

# create a Kalman Filter by hinting at the size of the state and observation
# space.  If you already have good guesses for the initial parameters, put them
# in here.  The Kalman Filter will try to learn the values of all variables.
# kf = KalmanFilter(transition_matrices=np.array([[1, 1], [0, 1]]),
#                   transition_covariance=0.01 * np.eye(2))

# You can use the Kalman Filter immediately without fitting, but its estimates
# may not be as good as if you fit first.
# states_pred = kf.em(observations).smooth(observations)[0]
# print('fitted model: {0}'.format(kf))

# Plot lines for the observations without noise, the estimated position of the
# target before fitting, and the estimated position after fitting.
